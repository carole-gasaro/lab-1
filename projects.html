    <strong>PROJECT</strong>
</p>
<body>
    <p>
        The Deusa Water Billing Station(DWBS) project was initiated as the final individual database project.
    </p>
    <p>
        DWBS is an organisation in charge of distributing water in the country (Rwanda). Due to its purpose, it has established multiple branches throughout the country to allow easy access to the people. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The database at DWBS was therefore, in charge of oversseing and collecting data on five relations namely: the clients, staff, inventory, transactions, and the different billing station branches.
